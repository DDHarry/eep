Erlang Enhancement Process
--------------------------

This repository contains in the subdirectory eeps/ the EEPs (Erlang
Extension Proposals), in [Markdown][MD] (*.md) format produced in the
[Erlang Enhancement Process][EEP].

It also contains a version of a [Markdown.pl][] script in subdirectory
md/ that can be used, for example with the also contained [Makefile][]
and some Perl build scripts, to produce HTML versions of the *.md EEPs.

Just typing `make` in a posix-compatible shell with any old 'make'
in the path plus a reasonable 'perl' (5.8) should build all HTML.
